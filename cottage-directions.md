# Directions to the Burton Family Cottage
* How to find the venue
* Directions from the Fairfield Inn & Suites in Fenton
* Directions from Detroit and points south
## Venue for the Ceremony, 5pm on Saturday, July 22
### Less precise: Address
The address of the Burton family cottage is **10007 Oakhurst Road in Rose Township, MI**. (Many map programs think it’s in Holly. That’s fine.) Google, Apple, and other map applications will get you most of the way, but not all the way, there with the address alone. There will be signs in the last mile to help you find the way. Between the GPS and the signs, you should be just fine.

### More precise: Latitude and Longitude
The easiest way to get accurate directions is to use the latitude and longitude of the driveway at the Burton property to find directions: [42°44'39.2"N 83°36'24.5"W][1].

Here are descriptive driving directions from the Fairfield Inn & Suites in Fenton and from Detroit:
1. Turn RIGHT out of the parking lot of the Fairfield Inn & Suites onto the service driveway, toward Silver Lake Road.
2. Turn RIGHT onto Silver Lake Road. Continue for approx. 1.3 miles.
3. Turn RIGHT onto N. Adelaide St. At the intersection of Adelaide and Silver Lake, you’ll see the Fenton Party Shop Liquor store and Pipsqueak Boutique catty corner to one another. Continue on Adelaide for 0.6 miles.
4. Turn LEFT onto South Holly St. It’s a 5-point intersection in a residential neighborhood.
5. Continue on this road out of town, for 6 miles. It starts out as South Holly St, but variously becomes South Holly Rd, South Fenton Road, and Millford Road. It’s mostly a straight shot, but you’ll continue straight through a 3-way stop at the railroad tracks, and then curve around to 90º to the right. After that, you’ll go through an S-curve. Shortly after that:
6. Turn LEFT onto Davisburg Road. Continue on Davisburg Road for approximately 0.5 mi.
7. Turn RIGHT onto Oakhurst Road. It’s a dirt road, and the entrance is a bit hidden by trees. There will be a sign.
8. Follow Oakhurst Road for approximately 0.8 miles. The driveway to the Burton family cottage is on the RIGHT. The driveway is at the bottom of a little hill, across from a marsh on the left. If you see the marsh on your right as well, then you’ve gone too far. There will be signs.
9. Stay RIGHT at the fork in the driveway, go up the hill, and parking is to the right.

Descriptive driving directions from Detroit and points south:
1. Follow I-75 north to exit 93, US 24 / Dixie Highway / Waterford.
2. At the end of the ramp, turn RIGHT onto US 24. Follow US 24 for 2.2 miles. You’ll pass a McDonalds and a Kroger on your left, not far before you:
3. Turn LEFT onto Davisburg Road. It is the first set of lights after the entrance to the Kroger.
4. Follow Davisburg Road for 6.6 miles. You’ll pass through some really sharp S-curves and through adorable downtown Davisburg. Shortly after passing the Journey Church sign on the left (the building, set back from the road, looks nothing like a church):
5. Turn LEFT onto Oakhurst Road. It’s a dirt road, and the entrance is a bit hidden by trees. There will be a sign.
6. Follow Oakhurst Road for approximately 0.8 miles. The driveway to the Burton family cottage is on the RIGHT. The driveway is at the bottom of a little hill, across from a marsh on the left. If you see the marsh on your right as well, then you’ve gone too far. There will be signs.
